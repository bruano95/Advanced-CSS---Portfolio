# Brandon Ruano's Portfolio
Creating a portfolio that highlights my strongest work and the creative processes behind it.

#Description

This website uses correct sematics within HTML as well as proper CSS layout to provide a prompt portfolio that can be used to show to future employers. Media queries are used within the CSS to provide correct and resposive changes for all screen sizes. Although not needed for the project, JavaScript was used within the ABOUT-ME section to provide furthur knowledge and skills. The website is used to show skills and knowledge of building a website from scratch.
